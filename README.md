# Dashboard

This is a sample portfolio project written using Angular2, with Typescript and SCSS. 
All the components are written from scratch with the exception of graph charts, which I decided it would be better to use a proven library, ChartJS, to speed up my development. I also use Google Material icons for additional aesthetic values (on top of, otherwise, text-only contents). 

## Concept

I choose dashboard as the development subject as it has the most approachable layout for any corporate business site.
In terms of coding, a dashboard management system allow for various features which I can build and further extend as I go.
With these 2 ideas, I can showcase my CSS (SCSS) skills to create a proper responsive administrative site layout, and my development skills (Angular2 + Typescript) to build sample features with Angular's components, services, etc.

### SCSS

I use SCSS for it's reusable variables within CSS. It helps a lot to modularise the CSS into collections of variables which can be changed with ease in future.
(Future ideas: Similarly, we can utilise such features to be build a standard site with changeable theme, with just tweaks of variables) 

### Angular2 + Typescript

Angular2(Ng2) runs natively with Typescript(TS), and TS is awesome! With Ng2, it eases my work to build a single feature components which can be reuse to contain different contents depending on which behavior the user may trigger. 
(Eg. In the current example project, slide-in panel is a parent component, which can display user profile, notification list or navigation links, depending whichever the user clicked.)

## Future references

I believe there is a lot more that can be done for faster, more efficient development. 
Like, usage of Bootstrap for responsiveness, Google Materials for cleaner interface design, as well as any javascript library. 
However, these development helpers are easy to implement, hence, I believe it would be a better showcase of my understandings in front-end, if I develop with basics.

## Feedbacks

I still have more to learn (such is life for a developer), so feel free to check my codes and drop me some comments at tendoujir@gmail.com.
